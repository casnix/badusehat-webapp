# badusehat-webapp

Badusehat is the name I've given to my hobby projects that consist of automating household systems, automating organization
of my life, playing with new technologies, cybersecurity research, and generally using the wrong tool for the job.  The
"bad use" part of the name is a reminder that I may be making a tool or component do something it wasn't designed to do,
"hacking" in the original meaning of the word.  The "hat" at the end of the name implies some connotation with cybersecurity,
of which I explore white-hat (ethical) topics and technologies.  

The Badusehat projects are intended to teach myself techniques for improvising when the right tools for the job aren't
available, making cost cutting decisions by using hardware or software that is not typically used to accomplish a particular
task, and making the technologies I work on more secure and robust against the growing threat of cyber-crime.

The purpose of this webapp is to give me a way to control automation from offsite, and to discuss my techniques and how
they work.
